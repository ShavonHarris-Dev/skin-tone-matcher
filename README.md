# Skin Tone Matcher

A web app that detects your skin tone from a photo and suggests matching colors, with clickable swatches that let you search for clothing in those colors. Built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/).

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** User uploads a photo.
2. **Skin Tone Detection:** The app analyzes the image using Pillow, filters out background pixels, and finds the dominant skin tone.
3. **Palette Mapping:** Maps the detected skin tone to a palette of matching colors.
4. **Search Links:** Each color swatch can be clicked to search for clothing of that color using Google Images.

## Customization

- **Color Names:** Add or edit color names for better search results.
- **Matching Logic:** Adjust how skin tone maps to palettes in `app.py`.
- **UI Enhancements:** Style the interface further with Streamlit components.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Streamlit not found:** Check your Python environment and PATH.
- **Missing color names:** Add them in the color name mapping in `app.py`.
- **Detection issues:** Use clear, well-lit, centered photos.

---

## Next Steps

- **Deploy:** Use [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or another Python web host to share your app.
- **Mobile:** Expand to mobile (see the React Native/Expo version in this repo for inspiration).
